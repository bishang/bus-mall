- I want to see a well designed website with nice colors, fonts, and layout.
- I want to know what the most popular items clicked are, so that we may target our consumer base with the most popular items.

# Developer
- Cycle through sets of three images.
- Make sure there are no duplicate images in each set.
- Make sure a product does not appear twice in a row.
- Track every click on each image.
